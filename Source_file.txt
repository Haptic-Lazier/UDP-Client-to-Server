Machine learning is one of the most exciting recent technologies.
In this class, you learn about the state of the art and also gain practice
implementing and deploying these machine learning algorithms yourself.
You've probably used a learning algorithm dozens of times a day without
knowing it.
Every time you use a web search engine like Google or Bing to search the
internet,
one of the reasons that works so well is because a learning algorithm, one
implemented
by Google or Microsoft, has learned how to rank web pages. Every time you
use Facebook or
Apple's photo typing application and it recognizes your friends' photos,
that's
also machine learning. Every time you read your email and your spam filter
saves you
from having to wade through tons of spam email, that's also a learning
algorithm.
